# Covid-Research

As we faced a new disease, COVID-19, the state and local governments of Texas followed safe protocols and shutdown our economy. All non-essential businesses were forced to close their doors. By analyzing
the new data from the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), I sought to find
a relationship between the number of cases of COVID-19 and the number of unemployed citizens. I
hypothesized that there is a negative relationship between the two factors, meaning that by increasing
the number of unemployed citizens the number of cases will decrease. From my analysis, the
relationship between the two factors is not significant, and therefore, continuing the shutdown is not
significant in reducing the number of cases of COVID-19.
